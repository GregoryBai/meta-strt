### **⚠️** If pressing on "Login" doesn't open up the metamask extension, then do it manually. Default behavior is such that Metamask dialog won't pop up if there is a pending confirmation. (Could be addressed by implementing an app-wide snackbar / notification system)

## A few improvements that could be made:
- Refactor store/Account
- Refactor public API's response data interfaces to allow better error / fallback handling
- Add notification to output warnings / errors
